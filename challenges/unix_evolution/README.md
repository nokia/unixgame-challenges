# The Evolution of Unix

Below is an article on the evolution of Unix, written by Dennis Ritchie:

Ritchie describes in it the early history of Unix, from its origins as an alternative to the Multics operating system to the rewriting of the kernel in C that took place in 1973. Besides being a reference historical article, it also contains technical details of initial Unix design choices on matters such as the file system of processes. Pipes (a great source of inspiration for these Unix50 challenges) are also discussed in great detail.  

The input file of this challenge contains the text version of that article.

### Questions

  * Q1. How many times is Unix's year of birth mentioned in the article?

<!-- Alternative easy questions (having 'Unix' or 'Bell' in the cards):
 - How many times is Unix / Bell Laboratories mentioned in the article? -->

  * Q2. Find the name of the Bell Labs location where Dennis Ritchie had his office.

  * Q3. Find the names of the four people that were most involved in the beginnings of Unix. Print them in the order in which their names appear in the text, including their initials.
  
  Tip: 6th paragraph.

  * Q4. Find the longest word or words (without hyphens) in the text. If there is a tie, the order in which you print them does not matter. Mind the casing!

  * Q5. Find the second-most-frequent 8-character word or words (without hyphens) in the text. If there is a tie, the order in which you print them does not matter. Mind the casing!
