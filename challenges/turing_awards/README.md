# The Turing Award

The ACM A. M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to an individual ["who has made lasting contributions of a technical nature to the computing community"](https://amturing.acm.org/). The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and the "Nobel Prize of computing."

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie received the Turing Award in 1983 ["for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system."](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/thompson_4588371.cfm).
